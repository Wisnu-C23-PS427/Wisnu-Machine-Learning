# Machine Learning repository for Wisata Nusantara

<h2>A machine learning model build with Tensorflow & Scikit-Learn to Recommends Items</h2>
<p>Hi. this is our repository for our project in capstone project Bangkit 2023 Batch 1. Our team consist of 2 people from Machine Learning Path.

All of the project management we take a place with Github repository, to distinguish each path we create a different repository.</p>

## Simple Description About Our Project
In this project, we create machine learning that is used to provide itinerary planning and find local tour guides based on recommendation systems and then we also provide some decisions for the results by showing the accuracy of the predictions.

## Our Tools or Infrastructure
- TensorFlow
- Scikit-Learn
